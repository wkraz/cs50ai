# CS50AI
## This is my work in Harvard's cs50ai course. There are 7 problem sets that cover the theory and implementation of AI/ML through Python OOP

### Problem Set 0: Search Algorithms (DFS/BFS, A* Search, Minimax)
Project 1: Create an AI that determines the degrees of separation between two actors via BFS (how many movies away they are from each other) \
Project 2: Create an AI that uses minimax to always make the optimal move in Tic-tac-toe
### Problem Set 1: Knowledge (Propositional logic, knowledge base, entailment, inference)
Project 1: Create an AI that solves the knights v. knaves logic game by encoding propositional logic in a knowledge base \
Project 2: Create an AI that uses inference to solve Minesweeper as best as possible
### Problem Set 2: Uncertainty (Bayes Rule/Bayesian Network, joint probability, Markov Models, sampling)
Project 1: Create an AI that ranks websites based on their determined importance \
Project 2: Create an AI that assesses the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait given their parents' genetics
### Problem Set 3: Optimization (simulated annealing, constraint satisfaction, arc consistency/AC3, backtracking)
Project 1: Create an AI that generates crossword puzzles (if possible) given a structure and word list by using a constraint satisfaction model
### Problem Set 4: Machine Learning (KNN, perceptron, loss functions, scikit-learn, q-learning)
Project 1: Create an AI that uses KNN to predict if an online shopper will complete a purchase given a csv describing their behavior \
Project 2: Create an AI that teaches itself to play the game Nim through reinforcement learning
### Problem Set 5: Neural Networks (TensorFlow, Keras, gradient descent, backpropogation, CNN)
Project 1: Create an AI that uses a Convolutional Neural Network through the Keras Tensorflow API to determine which traffic sign appears in a photograph
### Problem Set 6: Language Modeling (NLTK library, Naive Bayes Classifier, attention, transformers)
Project 1: Create an AI that parses sentences and extracts Noun Phrases \
Project 2: Create an AI that predicts a masked word in a text sequence using Google's BERT transformer-based MLM \
